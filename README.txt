CITATIONS:


We used our notes from class, or general tinkering to solve a much as we could.


To represent the graph, we used maps and sets and referred to these sites:

http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/map/map/

http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/set/set/


And we confirmed on stack overflow how to iterate over them:

To see if an element was in a set (for reciprocity):

JAMES:

After working out Djykstra's algorithm on paper many times, it was nice to finally implement it.  I also enjoyed using the standard library.  It helps so much to read about these structures and know how will they perform thanks to the newfound algorithm analysis knowledge that I have gained in this class.
